<ul><li>a <b>calorie calculator</b>, where the user will be asked to enter their age, gender, height, weight and activity. Based on the user's input, the calculator will present the user with the amount of calories they can consume to lose a certain amount of weight each week.</li>

<li><b>exercise suggestions</b>, which displays a vast amount of exercises that the user can do listed under different body area categories. Each section contains an image and a link to a separate page which will include more details about the certain exercise.</li>

<li><b>calendar</b>, which will send the user to google to authorize their account. After authorisation has been complete, the user's google calendar will be displayed on the page. The user will have the option to add a new event on this page.</li>

<li><b>recipe ideas</b>, where the user can enter the name for an ingredient which they have available. The webpage will return a list of meal ideas which the user can make using the ingredient.</li></ul>

<b>Future development ideas</b> include incorporating user's input for calories consumed, workouts done throughout the day and their weigh-ins. The application will dynamically apply calculations to the user's input and output visual representations for the data in the form of charts to map out their progress.
